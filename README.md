# Spritesheet Padder

Pads a sheet of sprites.

## TODO

- fix bottom row bleeds when there is padding
	+ is it a reading or writing problem? -- appears to be a writing problem
		- draw each tile in a separate file?
- add config to only extrude certain tiles. how to define?
	- by index? by individual tile? (like a grid?)
- finish: parameterize config values

## Usage

(WIP)
change your input.png to be what you want
update the config in index.js
run ./lib/index.js
